Scenario C â€“ Bug Fix: Draft selection adds a player but total points do not update.

1. Reproduce the issue:
   - Start a new draft.
   - Draft a player and observe that the player's data appears, but the team's total points remain the same.

2. Investigate the flow:
   - Confirm that the backend /team API recalculates points after each draft.
   - Check if the frontend calls the updated API or recalculates points in memory.
   - Inspect console logs and network requests to verify data updates.

3. Identify possible causes:
   - The frontend adds the player locally but does not trigger a recalculation.
   - The backend endpoint returns stale data because points are cached or not recomputed.
   - The 'points' field is missing from the player object in the UI state.

4. Apply the fix:
   - On the frontend, recalculate points whenever the team array changes or fetch the updated team data after drafting.
   - Example (React):
     useEffect(() => {
       if (team.length > 0) recalcTotalPoints();
     }, [team]);

   - On the backend, ensure that points are recalculated before sending the team response.

5. Verify:
   - Draft a player and confirm that the total points now update immediately.
   - Check that autodraft and removals also recalculate points correctly.

Result: Total points now update dynamically after each draft selection.
